<p><b>2012:</b> I had the opportunity to make my internship in the sixth semester of my Internet Technology studies at the FH JOANNEUM at OMICRON in Klaus in Vorarlberg. I created some TYPO3 extensions, fixed some other small things and improved the overall server performance of their web server a lot. I really liked it there, really a great place to work, especially for a guy like me who enjoys to work self-organized and autarkic.</p>
