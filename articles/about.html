<p><strong>bobdo</strong> is the personal portfolio of Richard Fussenegger. All work was done by me with help of Simon Dewert and Alexandar Georgiev at some stages of a few projects (they are mentioned if they were involved).</p>
<p>If youâ€™d like to know more about me, head over to my personal website <a target="_blank" href="http://richard.fussenegger.info/">richard.fussenegger.info</a>.</p>
<p>The name <strong>bobdo</strong> derives from an idea of a friend of mine (he owns the .com domain). Sadly he never did something with that great name and after we lost contact for no given reason I registered the .net domain and used it as my personal project page. Of course I would never make him his rights on the name contestable or create anything here that might be in direct competition to whatever he might create at the .com place.</p>
