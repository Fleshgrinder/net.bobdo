<p><b>2011:</b> Official website of my sister’s company. I also made business card, voucher and price sheet design for her. We still have to create some good photos of all that stuff. Check out the site and keep the link secret as long as the site isn’t finished.</p>
<p>I’m still fighting against a Webkit related bug here; click on “Impressum” in any browser other then a Webkit based and then do the same with a Webkit browser. Annoying!</p>
