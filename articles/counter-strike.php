<p><b>2010–2011:</b> <abbr title="Counter-Strike: Source">CSS</abbr> was our (Simon and mine) project for the “Multimediales Web” tution at the FH JOANNEUM. We re-created the original FH JOANNEUM as playable Counter-Strike: Source map with VALVe’s Hammer Editor. We had to create models, textures, and everything you can think of. The website is a bit broken because we’ve overwritten the CSS files accidently with a wrong version and lost the original. We’ll fix this sometime in the future.</p>
