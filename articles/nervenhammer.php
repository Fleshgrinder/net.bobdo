<p><b>2007–2008:</b> This was once a really big project for me. After my work for the DVD-Forum.at website we decided to do something new on our own. I wanted to create the whole website with news, forum and a wiki. I never learned so much in a short time about web developing as I did with this project (might also have to do with the fact that I didn’t know anything about it back then). I learned Linux, Apache, nginx, … just everything. The project died because we lost contact over the time.</p>
