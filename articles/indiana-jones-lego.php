<p><b>2007–2008:</b> This was a stop motion movie I made for my “Kunst &amp; Design” matriculation. The video isn’t available right now but I might upload it in the near future. I have to sort out my source files from back then. The video was a total success by the way.</p>
<p>The photo shows me directly before presenting my video to the audience at the final matriculation examination of “Kunst &amp; Design” back in 2008.</p>
