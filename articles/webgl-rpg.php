<p><b>2011:</b> We (Simon and me) started with this project for our “Projectwork 2” tution at the FH JOANNEUM, it was also the base for both of our first bachelor thesis. The idea was to create a 3D browser RPG based on the WebGL technology with a Western setting. We canceled the project because we felt that the final result isn’t good enough for our high standards.</p>
