<p>The development of a web server configuration for small to large web projects is the focus of my second bachelor thesis. The resulting configurations are the basis for benchmarks and projections that serve as reference for other test results. The main focus of the settings is on speed, security and resource consumption.</p>
<p>The first part deals with various criteria to facilitate the selection of the right hosting product. The so developed decision characteristics determine the hardware and software of the test system. The next section is devoted to fully configure the server. After each major system intervention tests follow that prove the increase in speed by the changes. The last section deals with possible extensions that can increase speed and security. At the end a résumé follows, which recaps the final configuration and the test results are discussed in more detail.</p>
<p>You can read the complete thesis online, please be aware that the text is written in German.</p>
