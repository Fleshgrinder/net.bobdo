<p>My first bachelor thesis deals with the development, history and possible future of WebGL (World Wide Web Graphics Library). WebGL is a royalty free 3D gra-phics application programming interface (3D-API) for web browser. It extends JavaScript in HTML5 canvas context and enables web browser to display 3D graphics without additional plug-ins.</p>
<p>At the beginning the history of 3D in the World Wide Web is described. Subsequently, the emergence of the WebGL standard will be elucidated, and the underlying technology briefly envisaged. Following various libraries and frameworks—so called WebGL wrapper—will be annotated. In subsequent chapters, two possible future declarative standards are presented and further explained. Before the final summary the main competitors of WebGL are briefly introduced.</p>
<p>At the end is the resume, in which a possible future of WebGL will be described, based on the personal impressions and experiences of the author in dealing with WebGL.</p>
<p>You can read the complete thesis online, please be aware that the text is written in German.</p>
