<p><b>Since 2006:</b> Wikipedia is of course not my personal project, but I love Wikipedia and I’ve done a lot there. I helped mainly in the SVG section of the German Wikipedia and Commons, but also created a few articles and other stuff. I haven’t done anything in a long time, mainly because I don’t have the time and the muse right now to help out.</p>
