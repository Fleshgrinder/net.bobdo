<p><b>2010–2011:</b> MovLib was my project for the “User Interfaces” tution at the FH JOANNEUM. This program is targeted towards collector’s of movies and should help them to manage their movie collections. It uses the OFDb database to achieve this. Entirely written in Java and because of that multi-platform and portable.</p>

<p><b>Mark:</b> “Sehr gut” (A) much more point then possible and best result of all.</p>
