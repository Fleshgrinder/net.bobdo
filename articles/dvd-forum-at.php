<p><b>2005–2008:</b> I worked there for nearly three years. I was moderator of the Horror Forum and often poached in the Asia Forum. I’ve also written reviews and other stuff, helped out with the archive. A lot of time went into this and I think many people liked me there a lot. I quit because it was hard work and because we (my friends back then) felt like that we need another platform to convey our message.</p>
